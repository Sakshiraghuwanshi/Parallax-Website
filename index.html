            <P class="text">An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky.or some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports,
                <br><br>
                Any activity that has thrill, excitement and a rush of adrenaline is termed an adventure. It can also come as a total surprise; nevertheless, barring few exceptions, the experience is always rewarding.
                Despite having a certain amount of risk involved, the adventure has a very positive effect on mind and health. Though a little scary, the experience leaves one in awe and a high level of adrenaline. A sudden rush of adrenaline is essential for improving one’s mental state of mind, making him/her more confident and happy.

                Biking is one of the low-impact activities that many people get into globally. While many people accept that cycling benefits their body and lifestyle, not everyone understands what they are.Cycling is a wonderful workout that keeps you active. It can help shape a healthy lifestyle, both physically and mentally. The adventure and buzz you get from coasting down hills and being outdoors mean that you are more likely to continue to cycle regularly, compared to other physical activities that keep you indoors or require special times or places.
                <br><br>
                Regularly riding a bike can lessen mental health disorders, including depression, tension, and anxiety. Stress, depression, or anxiety symptoms can be reduced by cycling. You may learn attentiveness and mindfulness by keeping your eyes on the road.

            <P class="text"> Paragliding pilots cover vast distances and climb to great heights simply by using naturally occurring forms of lifting air, known as ridge lift or thermals. You can soar freely in the sky and sightsee as you’ve never done before, giving you a whole new meaning to the phrase “a bird’s eye view.”Paragliding is often a gentler, calmer experience than most people may expect.
                <br><br>
                It is natural to feel nervous before attempting any new activity– paragliding included– but most people find that paragliding is not as scary as expected.You do not need to be very fit to tandem paraglide.

                    <p>SURFING</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <P class="text">Surfing is the sport of riding waves in an upright or prone position. Surfers catch the ocean, river, or man-made waves and glide across the surface of the water until they break and lose their energy.
                In the ocean, wave riders stand up on surfboards and navigate the water - nearly parallel to the beach - toward the shore.
                There are four types of surfing waves: spilling waves, plunging waves, surging waves, and collapsing waves.
                <br><br>
                The ultimate goal of surfing is to ride and progress on the unbroken part of the wave using a surfboard.
                Nevertheless, beginners can learn to surf in the whitewater part of the wave.
                Many surf historians and enthusiasts believe that the essence of surfing is in bodysurfing, the art of gliding over the waves using only the body as a planing surface.
